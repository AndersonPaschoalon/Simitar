    abstract = "In this paper we perform a detailed statistical analysis of \{IP\} traffic at flow level, based on data traces collected on the France Telecom wide area \{IP\} network. We particularly focus on the assessment of assumptions commonly used in flow level performance models, i. e. Poisson flow arrival process, both for \{UDP\} and \{TCP\} traffic. We first discuss the concept of flow and present a method to estimate an adequate Time Out value to distinguish different flows within a traffic stream. To model the flow arrival process, we find that Gamma and Weibull distributions provide excellent fits to the empirical flow inter-arrival time distributions. In addition, a fairly low level of correlation is detected between successive flow arrivals. Flow size distributions, though more difficult to model due to their composite aspect, show a very well marked heavy-tailed character of the Pareto type. We found that these results were very consistent among all the data traces we analyzed."
